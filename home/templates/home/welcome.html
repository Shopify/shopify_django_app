<h1 class="green">Welcome</h1>

<p>
  This is an example Shopify application that shows what you can do with the Shopify API.
</p>

<h3>1. Make sure you've entered a valid <em>API-Key</em> and <em>Secret</em></h3>

<p>
  If you haven't registered your application yet, then you must do so to obtain an API-Key and Secret.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shop owners can create applications for themeselves through their own admin (under Apps &gt; ManageApps)</li>
  <li>Shopify Partners create applications through their <a href="https://www.shopify.com/services/partners/api_clients">admin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  After registering your application with Shopify, you need to edit the <code>shopify_settings.py</code> file,
  and insert your <em>API-Key</em> and <em>Secret</em> there. Then restart this application.
</p>

<h3 id="callback-step">2. Make sure your <em>callback URL</em> is correct</h3>

<p class="description">
  The URL should be <code>{{ callback_url }}</code>, 
  with the host portion of the URL pointing to whichever domain is currently hosting this application. <br/> 
  The callback URL of your app can be changed in the API screen of your Shopify admin interface.
</p>

<h3>3. <a href="{% url shopify_app.views.login %}">Login</a> to your shop</h3>

<p class="description">
  On login, the shop owner will be redirected to a Shopify URL containing the <strong>API-Key</strong> of the application.
  The shop will need to grant access to your application to give it access to its private admin data.

  After authenticating, the browser will be redirected to the <code>shopify_app.views.finalize</code> view,
  which creates a session using the <strong>API-Secret</strong>, and then redirects to the example dashboard.<br/>
  The example view at <code>home.views.index</code> will get the shop's recent <code>Orders</code> and <code>Articles</code> through the
  Shopify <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html" title="Get more information about REST web services in general">REST</a> API and list them with all of your <code>Products</code>.
  You can click on a link of one of your objects and will then be taken to the corresponding admin area of your shop.<br/>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are no examples for <em>creating or editing</em> objects, but you are also able to do that with the Shopify API!</p>
</p>

<h3>4. Check out the source code of the <code>home.views.index</code> and its <code>home/index.html</code> template</h3>

<p class="description">
  You can analyze those files to see how the ShopifyAPI is used and get a glimpse of what's possible.
</p>

<h3>5. Read additional documentation</h3>

<p class="description">
  Become an expert.

<h3>6. Publish your application</h3>

<p class="description">
  This feature is not implemented yet, but it in the future it will allow you to register your application,
  so that will be shown in a public directory with a description, so that more users will take notice of it.
